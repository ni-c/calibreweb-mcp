# Build stage
#
# node:24-alpine is the ACTIVE LTS line, not the newest tag — roughly half of all
# Node majors never become LTS, so "newest" and "supported" are different things.
# What keeps this honest is a comparison, not a version number written down here:
# `node:lts-alpine` and `node:24-alpine` MUST resolve to the same digest. The day
# 24 leaves LTS they diverge, and that is visible; a hardcoded version in a comment
# is not. Verified 2026-09-01: both resolve to the digest below, Node 24.20.0.
# Refresh the digest and re-run that comparison together — a stale tag is
# invisible if only the digest is re-resolved.

# CVE-2026-14456: the pinned base image carries OpenSSL 3.5.7-r0, and Alpine's
# fixed 3.5.8-r0 has not been rebuilt into node:24-alpine yet. Upgrading these
# two packages by name rather than running a blanket `apk upgrade` keeps the
# rest of the image exactly as the digest pins it. Drop this once the base
# image ships the fix.
